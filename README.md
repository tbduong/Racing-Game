# Finding Derby
The goal of this project is to create a simple left to right racing game with the use of the basic fundamentals of html, css, javascript, and jQuery.  Players race by the button mashing of a key and the winner will win!

#Directions:
**Choose your seahorse:**

-Seahorse 1: key Q
-Seahorse 2: key P

**How to race?:**
Tap your key to pass your seahorse through the finish line! But, if you tap too fast... your seahorse will not listen to you! Keep an even pace!

#Technologies Used
* html
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* jQuery

#Existing Features
* Scoreboard that names the winner and tracks the score! (..but does not keep its data :-()

#Planned Features
* Players are able to win, but by using a key button counter to track the button presses--- it made the position of the player ambiguous on the board depending on the speed of the pressing. A stop queue, needs to be in place upon press to make sure the animation stops so it can move according to presses; Finish line with a margin should be implemented.
* The scoreboard will need improvement. It is able to track a score and add on to the win count, but there is no code to save the data. I would like to implement a Reset button (as opposed to a refresh button) to save the data and continue tallying the wins.
